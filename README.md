Chat App

Pull all the code for both frontend and backend and just run npm start in both of them.
I have only implemented authentication, api for create room, single chat, user details, login user, register user.
In frontend part I have only used chakraUI.
Used mongoDB, node.js, react.js, express.js.

this project needs more time to finish.
There are so many features to add to make this better app but due to time boundation of 24hrs I have not yet completed this app and have to submit.

If allowerd more time, I would love to add SocketIO in this app.
Make custom hook for localStorage.
Create better UI.
Use useContext hook for global store and so much more.

But irrespective of all that I had to submit, but if provided time I would love to finish this assignment.
